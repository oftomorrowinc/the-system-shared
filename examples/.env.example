# Example environment variables for the-system-shared API client
# Copy this file to .env and update the values as needed

# Base URL for the API
API_BASE_URL=https://us-central1-the-system-ai.cloudfunctions.net/

# API key for authentication (when required)
API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Webhook configuration for project notifications
# IMPORTANT: Use one of these two approaches, not both:

# OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED): Separate the base URL and path components
WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
WEBHOOK_PATH=/webhook/my-random-secret
WEBHOOK_PORT=3001

# OPTION 2: Include the path in the URL (remove or comment out WEBHOOK_PATH)
# WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhook/my-random-secret
# WEBHOOK_PORT=3001

# Optional webhook secret for verification (future use)
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-here
